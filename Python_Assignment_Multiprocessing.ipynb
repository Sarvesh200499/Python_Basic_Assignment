    " - Multiprocessing in Python is a built-in package that allows the system to run multiple processes simultaneously. It will enable the breaking of applications into smaller threads that can run independently.\n",
    "- Performing multiple operations for a single processor becomes challenging. As the number of processes keeps increasing, the processor will have to halt the current process and move to the next, to keep them going. Thus, it will have to interrupt each task, thereby hampering the performance.\n",
